# Full Stack API Project

## Full Stack Trivia

In this project users can test their knowledge answering random questions generated by Trvia game. Being involved in this task I had the responsability to create an API and test suite for implementing the following functionality:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the frontend directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
```
npm install
```

### Backend Dependencies
#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

py -m pip --version
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install virtualenv
py -m venv env
./env/Scripts/activate

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
CREATE trivia DB first and after run
psql -d trivia -U postgres -a -f trivia.psql

```

## Running the Frontend
In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start` then open http://localhost:3000 or change the scrip package.json file to run on different port.
```
npm start
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

## Testing 
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
Omit the first command if the test is run for the first time.

## API Reference
Hosted backend at http://localhost:5000/

### Error Handling

The API can return three types of errors:

1. 400 – bad request
2. 404 – resource not found
3. 422 – unprocessable

## Authors
Victoria Rotaru authored the API (__init__.py), test suite (test_flaskr.py), and this README.
All other project files, including the models and frontend, were created by Udacity as a project template for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.
