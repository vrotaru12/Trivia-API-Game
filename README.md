# Full Stack API Project

## Full Stack Trivia

In this project users can test their knowledge answering random questions generated by Trvia game. Being involved in this task I had the responsability to create an API and test suite for implementing the following functionality:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
